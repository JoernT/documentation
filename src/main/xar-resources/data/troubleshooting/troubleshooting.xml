      <para>This document contains hints and tips about troubleshooting problems. It also
                tells you where to find information (such as version numbers, log information, etc.)

      <title>Normal Start Up</title>

      <para>While eXist-db starts up, log output appears in the console. If you started
                eXist-db via the system tray launcher (default), the console output is captured and
                can be viewed by selecting the <literal>Show Tool Window</literal> menu entry in
                the system tray popup, then select <literal>Show console messages</literal>. If
                you launched eXist-db via one of the shell scripts, the output should directly
                appear in those.</para>
      <para>If eXist-db launched properly, you will find output similar to the following (this
                example output is taken from linux):</para>
      <example>
         <title>Console Output</title>
         <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="listings/listing-1.txt"/>
      </example>
      <para>When you see the "Server has started" message, and no further errors appear, you know that your eXist-db
                installation is working normally.</para>
      <para>However, if you do not even see this message, you should follow these troubleshooting steps</para>

   <sect1 xml:id="db-locked">
      <title>Database Refuses to Start</title>

      <para>If eXist-db was not shut down properly, it may start a recovery process to redo committed transactions and roll
                back uncommitted ones. If an inconsistency is found during this process, eXist-db will automatically abort the startup
                and print out a warning. This emergency stop is done to avoid potential damage and give an administrator a chance to check
                the db and create a backup. It does not necessarily indicate a real problem. In most cases, the db should be ok and restarting it will be save.</para>
      <para>However, we definitely recommend to run a <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="backup.xml#consistency-check">consistency check</link> in those cases. If inconsistencies are found, make sure you
                have a backup before continuing. If only one or two resources are affected, it might still be ok to restart, but it's
                good to have a backup just in case.</para>

                properly. Both variables are used in the <literal>startup.bat</literal> and
                <literal>startup.sh</literal> scripts and have to be set correctly before the
                scripts are run (you can also insert the lines required in the beginning of the

                        that you set JAVA_HOME. On macOS depending on how you installed eXist, you would open terminal and enter either:

   <sect1 xml:id="port-conflicts">
      <title>Port Conflicts</title>

      <para>eXist-db can fail to start up if another service on
                your system is using port 8080 or 8443, the default ports that eXist's embedded web server, Jetty, uses. To see whether this is the case, enter <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</link> in your browser. If
                another service occupies this port, you cannot start up eXist-db unless you shut
                down the service in question or make eXist-db use another port. To make eXist-db use
                another port, open the file <literal>/tools/jetty/etc/jetty-http.xml</literal> inside your eXist-db installation in a
                text or XML editor and change the value "8080" in</para>
      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xml" xlink:href="listings/listing-5.xml"/>

      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xml" xlink:href="listings/listing-6.xml"/>
      <para>eXist-db uses port 8443 for confidential communication. Another service may also
                be using this port. To make eXist-db use another port, open the file <literal>/tools/jetty/etc/jetty-ssl.xml</literal> and change the value
                "8443" in</para>
      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xml" xlink:href="listings/listing-7.xml"/>

      <para>If these scripts do not launch eXist-db, you can launch it by changing to the
                directory where you installed eXist-db and entering the following into the

      <title>Using the Logs</title>

      <para>If you experience any problems while using eXist-db, your first step should be
                to check the log files to get additional information about the source of the
                problem. eXist-db uses the <emphasis>log4j-package</emphasis> to write output logs to
                files. By default, this output is written to the directory <literal>webapp/WEB-INF/logs</literal>.
                Or, if you are running eXist as a service, check the directory <literal>tools/yajsw/logs</literal>. The
                main log files for eXist itself are <literal>exist.log</literal> and
                <literal>xmldb.log</literal>.

      <title>Out of Memory</title>

      <para>Running out of memory typically throws Java into an inconsistent state: some threads may still be alive and continue
                to run while others have died. It is thus important to avoid memory errors up front by checking the memory consumption of
                your queries before they go into production. Should you encounter an out of memory error, please make sure to restart
                eXist and follow the emergency procedure.</para>

         <title>Streaming Large Files</title>

         <para>If you have to generate large binaries, e.g. a ZIP or PDF, from within an XQuery, please ensure the content
                    does not need to be kept in memory. There are various XQuery functions which directly stream to the HTTP response.</para>
         <para>There's also a known issue with the betterform XForms filter caching every HTTP response. To work around this,
                    your XQuery should be run via an URL which is not processed by the XForms filter: either disable the filter or use
                    /rest or /restxq.</para>
