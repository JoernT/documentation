      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>This article explains the best practices for upgrading eXist-db. It introduces key concepts and provides instructions for different types of upgrades. Following these instructions will ensure your data is properly backed up and preserved during the upgrade process.</para>

      <title>Key concepts</title>

      <para>The primary goal of an eXist upgrade is to migrate your eXist application to a new version while preserving the contents of your database.</para>
      <para>Before embarking on an upgrade, you should first review the new version's release notes (see the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/wiki/blogs/eXist/">eXist Developer's Blog</link> for an archive of all past release notes). The release notes introduce the new version's new features, improvements, and bug fixes, but they also outline any new requirements (e.g., the required version of Java). For the purpose of this guide, the most important item in the release notes is whether the new version is <emphasis>binary-compatible</emphasis> with the previous version or not. Pay close attention to these notes, as they will tell you which upgrade route to follow here.</para>
      <para>If a new version is binary-compatible with the previous version, it means that the format eXist uses to store the contents of the database has not changed, so the data can be used by new version without modification. However, if a new version is not binary-compatible, then it means that the new version of eXist has changed the way it reads data from or stores data into the database. As a result, some additional steps are required to migrate your data to the new version of eXist.</para>
      <para>You should always back up your data before upgrading to any new version of eXist; the directions below indicate when and how to perform a backup. Why is backing up data important before an upgrade? Of course, upgrade procedures are tested with each release, but as with any software upgrade, unexpected events can occur, so these procedures give you a backup of your data that you can revert to with your previous version of eXist and resume work.</para>
      <para>For the same reason, you should not install the new version of eXist over the previous version. Instead, these instructions have you install the new version into a fresh new directory.</para>

      <para>Follow these steps if the new version of eXist is not binary-compatible with the your old version.
                (Check the new version's release notes to find out whether it is binary compatibility with your old version.)
                Additional steps are required when upgrading to a new version of eXist whose database format is not binary-compatible with your old installation.
                The key difference is that you must perform a <emphasis>full restore</emphasis> of your backed up data onto the new installation of eXist,
                rather than simply copying the data directory to the new installation.</para>

      <para>Should you need to perform non-incremental upgrade across mutiple non-compatible releases, e.g. from 1.4 to 3.6, we strongly recommend to first check past release notes to understand how breaking changes might affect you.</para>
