      <title>Abstract</title>

      <para>From our and our clients' experiences of developing and using eXist-db in production environments a number of lessons have been learned. This Good Practice guide is an attempt to cover some of the considerations that should be taken into account when deploying eXist-db for use in a production environment.</para>
      <para>The concepts laid out within this document should not be considered absolute or accepted wholesale - they should rather be used as suggestions to guide users in their eXist-db deployments.</para>

      <title>The Server</title>

      <para>Ensure that your server is up-to-date and patched with any necessary security fixes.</para>
      <para>eXist-db is written in Java - so for performance and security reasons, please ensure that you have the latest and greatest Java JDK release that is compatible with your version of eXist. The latest version can always be found here at: <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</link> and the recommended major version for a given eXist release can be found at: <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://bintray.com/existdb/releases/exist#read">https://bintray.com/existdb/releases/exist#read</link>

      <title>Install from Source or Release?</title>

      <para>Most users will install an officially released version of eXist-db on their production systems, usually this is perfectly fine. However there can be advantages to installing eXist-db from source code on a production system.</para>
      <para>eXist-db may be installed from source code to a production system in one of two ways:</para>
      <variablelist spacing="compact">
         <varlistentry>
            <term>via Local Build Machine (preferred)</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>You checkout the eXist-db code for a release branch (or trunk) from our GitHub repository to a local machine, from here you build a distribution which you test and then deploy to your live server.</para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
         <varlistentry>
            <term>Directly from GitHub</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>In this case you don't use a local machine for building an eXist-db distribution, but you checkout the code from a release branch (or the develop branch) directly from our GitHub repository on your server and build it in-situ.</para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>If you install eXist-db from source code, some advantages might be:</para>

      <warning>
         <para>
                        <emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> - eXist's code trunk is generally not recommended for production use, whilst it should always compile and be relatively stable, it may also contain as yet unrecognised regressions or result in unexpected behaviour.
                    </para>

         <title>Upgrading</title>

         <para>If you are upgrading the version of eXist-db that you use in your production system, please always follow these two points:</para>

            <title>eXist-db Permissions</title>

            <para>At present eXist-db ships with fairly relaxed permissions to facilitate rapid application development, but for production systems these should be constrained:</para>
            <variablelist spacing="compact">
               <varlistentry>
                  <term>admin account</term>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>The default permissions for creating resources and collections in eXist-db are set in <literal>conf.xml</literal>. The current settings are fairly sane, but you may like to improve on them for your own application security.</para>

                     <para>The default permissions for /db are 0755, which should be sufficient in most cases. In the case you needed to change this, you could do that with (here for 0775):</para>

            <title>Operating System Permissions</title>

            <para>eXist-db should be deployed and configured to run whilst following the security best practices of the operating system on which it is deployed.</para>
            <para>Typically we would recommend creating an "exist" user account and "exist" user group with no login privileges (i.e. no shell and empty password), changing the permissions of the eXist-db installation to be owned by that user and group, and then running eXist-db using those credentials. An example of this on OpenSolaris might be:</para>
            <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="bash" xlink:href="listings/listing-2.txt"/>

      <sect2>
         <title>Attack Surface</title>

         <para>For any live application it is recognised best practice to keep the attack surface of the application as small as possible. There are three aspects to this:</para>
         <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>Limiting means of arbitrary code execution.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <para>Reducing the application itself to the absolute essentials.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               <para>Limiting access routes to the application.</para>
            </listitem>
         </orderedlist>
         <para>eXist-db is no exception and should be configured for your production systems so that it provides only what you need and no more. For example, the majority of applications will be unlikely to require the WebDAV or SOAP Admin features for operation in a live environment, and as such these and other services can be disabled easily.</para>
         <para>Means for anonymous users to execute arbitrary code require special attention. There are two means of code execution in eXist, which make sense during development, but should be reconsidered for production systems.</para>

               <listitem>
                  <para>We recommend to prevent  eXist's REST server from directly recieving web requests, and use URL Rewriting to control code execution via URL instead. This feature is enabled by default in <literal>$EXIST_HOME/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</literal>. Changing the param-value to true, allows you to filter request via your own XQuery controller.</para>

If you are operating in standalone mode, this is done via server.xml, else see webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml. You should look at each configured service, servlet or filter and ask yourself - do we use this?

      <title>Web Deployments</title>

      <para>eXist-db like any Web Application Server (Tomcat, WebLogic, GlassFish, etc.) should not be directly exposed to the Web. Instead, we would strongly recommend proxying your eXist-db powered Web Application through a Web Server such as <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</link> or <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTPD</link>. See <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="production_web_proxying.xml">here</link> for further details.</para>
      <para>If you proxy eXist-db through a Web Server, then you may also configure your firewall to only allow external access directly to the Web Server. If done correctly this also means that web users will not be able to access any eXist-db services except your application which is proxyied into the Web Servers namespace.</para>

         <title>Enable GZip Compression</title>

         <para>eXist-db by default operates inside the Jetty Application Server, Jetty
                    (and most other Java Application Servers) provides a mechanism for enabling
                    dynamic GZip compression of resources. This is to say that Jetty can be
                    configured to dynamically GZip compress any resource received from the server by
                    HTTP. Potentially for large resources, or even for frequently used resources.
                    Enabling dynamic GZip compression can reduce the size of transfers, and as such
                    reduce the transfer time of resources from the server to the client, hopefully
                    resulting in a faster experience for the end-user.</para>
         <para>GZip Compression can be enabled in web.xml, which can be found in either
                    $EXIST_HOME/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml for default deployments or
                    $EXIST_HOME/tools/jetty/etc/standalone/WEB-INF/web.xml for standalone
                    deployments.</para>
